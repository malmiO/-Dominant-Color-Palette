# Dominant Color Palette

### This application developed to analysis color images using OpenCV and Python with K-means clustering.This application build with in Google Colabs but can use in other editers.

## Steps

#### 1.Upload an Image: Run the script and use the file upload dialog to select an image.

#### 2.Display the Uploaded Image: The uploaded image will be displayed using OpenCV.

#### 3.Convert to RGB Format: Convert the BGR format (default in OpenCV) to RGB for visualization purposes.

#### 4.Reshape Image Data: Reshape the image data into a 2D array.

#### 5.Apply K-means Clustering: Use K-means clustering to identify dominant colors in the image.

#### 6.Visualize Dominant Colors: Display the dominant colors identified



#### after that you can see the HSV format and RGB format. Also the diferences between them

#### Additional steps

#### 7.Convert to HSV: Optionally, convert the image to HSV format for different color space analysis.

#### 8.Repeat for Different Images: The script can be used repeatedly for different images by changing the file path.

Note
Adjust the k value (number of clusters) in the K-means clustering section to experiment different numbers of dominant colors.
